 * Class BanChatMember
 *
 * Use this method to ban a user in a group, a supergroup or a channel. In the case of supergroups and channels, the user will not be able to return to the chat on their own using invite links, etc., unless [unbanned](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#unbanchatmember) first. The bot must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the appropriate administrator rights. Returns *True* on success.
